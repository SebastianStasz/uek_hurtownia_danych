# ELO World Cup Rankings [Archived]

Project Completed as Part of the "Data Warehouses" Course

### The repository contains:

1. A scraper written in Python that collects information about the World Cup match results starting from 1930 (only group and knockout stages).  
   The collected data is stored in the file **"worldCupData.json"**.

2. A program written in Swift that, based on the collected data, generates a country ranking using the **ELO algorithm**.  
   An example ranking for the algorithm constant 5 is stored in the file **"Result for constant 5.txt"**.
